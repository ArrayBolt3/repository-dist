tbb-keys.d
==========
- Only used in /usr/bin/torbrowser.
- Not required to have a -revoked.d folder, because keys in the
  tbb-keys.d folder are only temporarily added to a temporary gpg
  verification folder every time the update-torbrowser script verifies Tor
  Browser.

tpoarchive-keys.d
=================
- Keys in tpoarchive-keys.d folder are only used by the
  /usr/share/whonix/chroot-scripts-post.d/40_add_torprojects_key chroot post.d
  script.
- It must only be up to date only when building Whonix from source
  code, not necessarily when creating update packages.
- After that it will be kept updated by the deb.torproject.org-keyring deb
  package. Therefore, it's not necessary to have a tpoarchive-keys-revoked.d
  folder.

whonix-news-keys.d
==================
- Only used in /usr/lib/whonixcheck/50_check-whonix-news.
- Not required to have a -revoked.d folder, because keys in the
  whonix-news-keys.d folder are only temporarily added to a temporary gpg
  verification folder every time whonixcheck verifies Whonix News.

whonix-keys.d
=============
- When Whonix's APT repository has been enabled (in /etc/whonix.d/ or in
  /root/.whonix.d/) (using the whonix_repository tool), then:
  keys in whonix-keys.d folder will be added next time the whonix_repository
  tool runs.
- When Whonix's APT repository has been disabled (in /etc/whonix.d/ or in
  /root/.whonix.d/) (using the whonix_repository tool), then:
  keys in whonix-keys.d folder will be revoked next time the whonix_repository
  tool runs.

whonix-keys-revoked.d
=====================
- Keys in this folder will be revoked next time the whonix_repository tool
  runs.
