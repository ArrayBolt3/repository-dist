Description: Derivative APT Repository Tool
 This tool can always be used to enable either Derivative's stable, testers or
 developers repository or to disable Derivative's repository.
 .
 Derivative's APT Repository is not enabled by default. Some users prefer this
 for trust/security reasons.
 .
 On first boot of Derivative, the Derivative Repository Tool gets automatically
 started by setup-dist. The user is free to either leave Derivative's
 repository disabled or to configure it as desired.
 .
 Technically speaking, this tool creates or deletes
 /etc/sources.list.d/derivative.list and adds or deletes Derivative's signing key
 from apt-key.
